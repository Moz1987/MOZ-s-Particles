# MOZ-s-Particles
a cheap prefab for vrchat

HELLO ^_^) Welcome to MOZ's particles prefab v7 readme!
Choose one of the 3 version of the particles or feel free to edit them to your liking/needs!

I AM A BEGINNNER WHAT IS THIS?
Pretty simple; these are world particles so you will need rigidbody fixed joint but is 90% already set up for you. 
Add the MOZ's particle prefab example, found inside Example hierarchy folder, to your scene: it has a rigidbody component with setting to use on your wrists.
Copy those on your avatar's wrists then assign them on fixed joint compoenent of MOZ particles, ''MOZ particles L'' fixed on left wrist and R on right wrist
particles must be placed there same place as example hierarchy, child of model but outside of armature or body. 
Move them on your avatar's palms in the scene but not the hierarchy, i like to keep my left particles on the tip of index finger.

--Animations are provided, just copy their keyframes to your preferrend hand gesture, fingers aren't posed--
I use fist to remove safety and finger point to activate particles so i don't have to hold fist, just don't lift your index (i have oculs idk about vive/wMR)

I AM NOT A BEGINNER MOZ!
If you already know how to set up world particles for vrchat just use the MOZ particles L and R prefabs like any other world particles.
The idea is that a globe of particles appear in your hands, you hold them in the right one and flick the left one to throw particles around
They have a cool momentum / spring effect to go back, is easy to edit to your liking.

WHY YOU MADE IT?!?:
Will look hilarious if you change particles to prefab cubes, shader icons, blender icons and so on, and throw them at peoples faces
some alpha mask textures are provided, also a doolar bill and a paper sheet, add your own text to it like NO ANIME, TRAPS ARE GAY, ONE MONTH and so on
You will need to edit rotation over lifetime and add a bit of noise to make them look like floating

Prefab looks ok but is very stock, feel free to edit it, if you don't like the color change color over lifetime on the default green prefab, for example.
Animations are provided, just copy their keyframes to your preferrend hand gesture, fingers aren't posed

ABOUT COLLISIONS:
I added them and send collision messages too, it was fun to break stuff with those but kinda laggy,
if you want collision i suggest adding them only on one of the 4 in total emitters, 
i am left handed so i have them on one of the emitters of left hand only.
Or just lower down the emission rate XD
